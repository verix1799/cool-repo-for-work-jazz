## Exercise 1: Today's Highlights

Using this image, implement it using HTML and CSS.

* Try to duplicate it as closely as possible
* Use Flexbox and/or Grid for layout
* Use media queries to make it responsive. For example, maybe the image is hidden on smaller screens and the fonts are smaller.
* Use images from https://placeholder.com/ or similar for images.

## Exercise 2: Copywork Project

WHen it comes to front-end development, the easiest way to learn is to build something that already exists. We're not practicing product design so let's remove that complexity. This is called copywork.

1. Create a new index.html and style.css
2. Add the HTML5 boilerplate code to index.html using VSCode 
3. Choose an app or website that you are familiar with and try to recreate it using HTML and CSS.
