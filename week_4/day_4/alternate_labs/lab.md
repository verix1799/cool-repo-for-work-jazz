## Hacker News Client

Build a filterable front-end for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Using the following endpoints, allow the user to view a list of top stories, and filter them by title.

- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json - Latest Stories
- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{storyId}.json - Story Detail

Choose this project if you want to practice:

- - Components, state (`useState`), props and `useEffect`.
- Working with requests
- Working with forms

_*Hint:*_ How can you send multiple requests and wait for responses? Research [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all).
