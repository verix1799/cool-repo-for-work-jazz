var myBill = [{
  meal: 'Green Curry',
  price: 10,
  customer: 'Sally'
}, {
  meal: 'Sea Bass',

}]

// Extension

// Part 3
// Have a look at the following bodyBuilder object.

var bodyBuilder = {
  strength: 2,
  workOut: (mins) => {
    bodyBuilder.strength = bodyBuilder.strength * mins;
  }
}

// 3.a. Log out the the bodyBuilder's strength - the value should be 2.

// 3.b. Use the workOut function to update the bodyBuilder's strenth.

// 3.c. Create another function on the bodyBuilder called `lazeAbout`, that takes in a number of hours as an argument. Decrease the bodyBuilder's strength by dividing the strength by the number of hours.
